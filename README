To compile this program, you can run it with "make" in the command line.

To run this program, enter the commands 
"colorpalette <Input image file> <Output image file> <Palette Text File>".  The palette text file
is simply a text file with rgb values on each line representing a select color on the 
palette.  Several .txt files are provided to run demos of this program.

Included Palette Text Files to use:
2.txt - includes only black and white on the palette.
3.txt - includes the colors red, green, and blue.
5.txt - includes red, green, blue, black, and white.
8.txt - includes red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet, black, and white.
100.txt - includes an assortment of around 100 colors.
b.txt - includes only shades of blue.
r.txt - includes only shades of red.
g.txt - includes only shades of green.
sm.txt - includes blue, red, black, and white
grey.txt - includes only shades of grey.

You may create your own txt file of rgb coordinates if desired.

The file will be automatically written to the output image file location with the desired
color changes automatically applied to the image.
